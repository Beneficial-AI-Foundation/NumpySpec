# NDArray Implementation Summary

## Overview

This new NDArray implementation provides a type-safe, n-dimensional array library for Lean 4 with compile-time shape information.

## Key Features

### 1. **Compile-Time Shape as Vector of Naturals**
- Shape is represented as an inductive type: `Shape.nil` for empty shape, `Shape.cons n s` for adding dimensions
- Shape information is part of the type: `NDArray α shape`
- Total size is computed at compile-time from the shape

### 2. **Type-Safe Indexing**
- Index type matches the shape structure exactly
- Compile-time bounds checking through dependent types
- No runtime index out of bounds errors in well-typed code

### 3. **N-Dimensional Support**
- Supports arbitrary dimensions (tested up to 5D)
- Uniform API across all dimensions
- Natural representation for tensors, images, videos, etc.

### 4. **Core Operations Implemented**
- Creation: `zeros`, `ones`, `arange`, `fromList`
- Access: `get`, `set` with type-safe indices
- Transformations: `map`, `map2`, `fold`, `sum`
- Reshaping: `reshape` with compile-time size preservation check
- Display: `toList` for testing and debugging

## Test Coverage

The test suite demonstrates:
- ✅ 1D arrays (vectors)
- ✅ 2D arrays (matrices)
- ✅ 3D arrays (tensors)
- ✅ 4D arrays (ML batches: batch × height × width × channels)
- ✅ 5D arrays (video/time-series data)
- ✅ Edge cases (scalars, single elements, empty dimensions)
- ✅ Reshaping with size preservation
- ✅ Element-wise operations

## Next Steps for Full Numpy Compatibility

1. **Broadcasting**: Implement automatic shape expansion for operations
2. **Axis Operations**: Reductions along specific axes (sum, mean, max)
3. **Linear Algebra**: Matrix multiplication, dot product, transpose
4. **Slicing**: Extract sub-arrays and views
5. **Advanced Indexing**: Boolean masks, fancy indexing
6. **More Data Types**: Support Float, Complex, etc.
7. **Performance**: Optimize with SIMD operations

## Migration from Old Implementation

The new NDArray is designed to coexist with the existing LeanArrayLib:
- Old: Runtime shape in Layout, limited to 1D/2D hardcoded
- New: Compile-time shape as type parameter, unlimited dimensions
- Both can be used during transition period

## Usage Example

```lean
-- Create a 3D tensor [2,3,4]
let shape3d := Shape.cons 2 (Shape.cons 3 (Shape.cons 4 Shape.nil))
let tensor := NDArray.arange shape3d

-- Access element at [0,1,2]
if let some idx := Index.fromList? shape3d [0, 1, 2] then
  let value := tensor.get idx  -- value = 6

-- Element-wise operations
let doubled := tensor.map (· * 2)

-- Reshape to [6,4]
let shape2d := Shape.cons 6 (Shape.cons 4 Shape.nil)
if h : shape3d.size = shape2d.size then
  let matrix := tensor.reshape h
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a formally verified numpy-like library in Lean 4.
