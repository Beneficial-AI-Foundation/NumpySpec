# NDArray Vector-Based Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully rewrote the NDArray implementation to use Vector for compile-time shape representation instead of the custom Shape type, following CLAUDE.md guidelines to prefer Vector & Array over List.

## Key Changes

### 1. Shape Representation
- **Before**: Custom `Shape` inductive type
- **After**: `Vector Nat n` for compile-time shape tracking

### 2. Core Types
```lean
-- Shape size computation
def shapeSize {n : Nat} (shape : Vector Nat n) : Nat :=
  shape.toArray.foldl (· * ·) 1

-- Index type with Vector-based shape
structure Index {n : Nat} (shape : Vector Nat n) where
  coords : Vector Nat n
  valid : ∀ i : Fin n, coords.get i < shape.get i

-- Main NDArray structure
structure NDArray (α : Type) (n : Nat) (shape : Vector Nat n) where
  data : Array α
  size_proof : data.size = shapeSize shape
```

### 3. Implementation Details
- Used `Array` for efficient data storage
- Row-major memory layout with `computeStrides`
- Type-safe indexing with compile-time bounds checking
- Support for n-dimensional arrays (tested 0D to 5D)

### 4. Fixed Issues
- Replaced deprecated `Array.mkArray` with `Array.replicate`
- Fixed `Array.zipWith` syntax (function comes first)
- Used `Array.size_replicate` theorem correctly
- Fixed mutable variable handling with `Id.run do`
- Replaced `List.get!` with array indexing syntax `arr[i]!`

### 5. Test Coverage
- 1D Arrays: Basic operations, element access
- 2D Arrays: Matrix operations, arithmetic
- 3D Arrays: Multi-dimensional indexing
- 4D Arrays: ML-style batch processing
- 5D Arrays: High-dimensional support
- Edge cases: Scalar (0D), single element, empty dimensions
- Operations: reshape, map, fold, sum, product

## Benefits of Vector-Based Approach
1. **Compile-time shape validation**: Dimensions known at compile time
2. **Type safety**: Operations only allowed on compatible shapes
3. **Performance**: Uses efficient Array storage internally
4. **Memory efficiency**: Avoids List overhead
5. **CLAUDE.md compliance**: Follows project guidelines

## Test Results
All tests passing successfully with proper Vector-based implementation.
