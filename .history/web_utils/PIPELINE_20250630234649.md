# Pipeline for Generating NumPy Operations JSON Files

This document outlines the step-by-step process for generating comprehensive NumPy operations documentation in JSON format.

## Overview

The goal is to create structured JSON files containing NumPy function documentation, including names, descriptions, URLs, full documentation, and code references.

## Step-by-Step Pipeline

### 1. Initial Request - Identify Target Functions and Gather Function Lists

**Prompt:**
```
Use the browsermcp tool to search for all numpy dense matrix linalg operations such as diagonal, transpose and etc. available. Make a list of them in web_utils/linalg_ops.json, just the names and urls to the exisiting documentation, leave the in-depth investigation later.
```

### 2. Create Initial JSON Structure & Fetch Documentations

**Prompt:**
```
"Use browsermcp and other tools to search for the docstring and source code, store them in web_utils/output/linalg_operation.json. For each function, create a JSON entry with these fields:
{
  "name": "numpy.linalg.function_name",
  "description": "Brief one-line description",
  "url": "Official NumPy documentation URL",
  "doc": "Full documentation string with parameters, returns, examples",
  "code": "Implementation or reference to source"
}
Remember, grab all the functions in the list in web_utils/linalg_ops.json, and store them in web_utils/output/linalg_operation.json. If you are not able to conduct that much work in a sequence, you may try to create sub-tasks or sub-agents to do the work: Decompose the linalg operations into smaller sub-tasks, such as matrix_vector_products, decompositions, eigenvalues, norms, solving_equations, other_ops, and handle them using sub-agents, which store the results separately in web_utils/. If you are doing so, output the draft file list for reference.
```

### 2. (Possible Follow-up) Merge and Unify Format

**Prompt:**
```
"Merge all individual JSON files in the list into a single comprehensive file with this structure:
{
  "numpy_linalg_operations": {
    "category_name": [array of functions],
    ...
  },
  "metadata": {
    "total_functions": N,
    "categories": M,
    "generated_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "source": "NumPy v2.3 documentation and GitHub repository"
  }
}"
```

### 3. Fixing Potential Issues and Fetching MoreSource Code

**Prompt:**
```
Currently, in web_utils/output/linalg_operations.json, there are some values which is not detailed docstring and source code, but rather a link to specific lines instead of a complete code which could be found on Github, fix them by using your mcp tool to fetch the doc and code from url given. For C-implemented functions, note that they are 'C implementation' with a reference.
```


```

### 6. Handle Multiple Files

**Initial approach (if needed):**
```
"Create separate JSON files for each category:
- matrix_vector_products.json
- decompositions.json
- eigenvalues.json
- norms.json
- solving_equations.json
- other_ops.json"
```

### 7. Merge and Unify Format

**Prompt:**
```
"Merge all individual JSON files into a single comprehensive file with this structure:
{
  "numpy_linalg_operations": {
    "category_name": [array of functions],
    ...
  },
  "metadata": {
    "total_functions": N,
    "categories": M,
    "generated_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "source": "NumPy v2.3 documentation and GitHub repository"
  }
}"
```

### 8. Fix Incomplete Entries

**Prompt:**
```
"Check for any entries where 'code' contains just a URL or reference.
For these, fetch the actual code from the GitHub URLs provided.
For C implementations, keep the reference but make it clear."
```

### 9. Flatten Nested Structure

**Prompt:**
```
"Transform the JSON to remove the nested 'add' field and create a flat structure:
{
  "name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "url": "...",
  "doc": "...",
  "code": "..."
}"
```

### 10. Clean Up

**Prompt:**
```
"Remove all draft files and temporary scripts.
Keep only the final unified JSON files in web_utils/output/"
```

## Key Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: Specify exact module names (numpy.linalg, numpy, etc.)
2. **Request Categories**: Ask for logical grouping of functions
3. **Define Format Early**: Provide the exact JSON structure you want
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Don't expect perfect results in one go
5. **Verify Completeness**: Ask to check total function count against NumPy docs
6. **Handle Edge Cases**: Be prepared for C implementations, aliases, deprecated functions

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Incomplete Code**: Many NumPy functions are C implementations - accept references instead of full code
- **Nested Structures**: Explicitly request flat structure if that's what you need
- **Missing Documentation**: Some functions may need manual documentation fetching
- **Format Consistency**: May need a final pass to ensure all entries follow the same format

## Example Final Output Structure

```json
{
  "numpy_linalg_operations": {
    "matrix_vector_products": [
      {
        "name": "numpy.dot",
        "description": "Dot product of two arrays",
        "url": "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html",
        "doc": "Complete documentation...",
        "code": "Implementation or reference..."
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "total_functions": 46,
    "categories": 6,
    "generated_date": "2024-XX-XX",
    "source": "NumPy v2.3 documentation and GitHub repository"
  }
}
```
