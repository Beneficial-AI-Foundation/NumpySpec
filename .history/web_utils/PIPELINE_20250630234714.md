# Pipeline for Generating NumPy Operations JSON Files

This document outlines the step-by-step process for generating comprehensive NumPy operations documentation in JSON format.

## Overview

The goal is to create structured JSON files containing NumPy function documentation, including names, descriptions, URLs, full documentation, and code references.

## Step-by-Step Pipeline

### 1. Initial Request - Identify Target Functions and Gather Function Lists

**Prompt:**
```
Use the browsermcp tool to search for all numpy dense matrix linalg operations such as diagonal, transpose and etc. available. Make a list of them in web_utils/linalg_ops.json, just the names and urls to the exisiting documentation, leave the in-depth investigation later.
```

### 2. Create Initial JSON Structure & Fetch Documentations

**Prompt:**
```
"Use browsermcp and other tools to search for the docstring and source code, store them in web_utils/output/linalg_operation.json. For each function, create a JSON entry with these fields:
{
  "name": "numpy.linalg.function_name",
  "description": "Brief one-line description",
  "url": "Official NumPy documentation URL",
  "doc": "Full documentation string with parameters, returns, examples",
  "code": "Implementation or reference to source"
}
Remember, grab all the functions in the list in web_utils/linalg_ops.json, and store them in web_utils/output/linalg_operation.json. If you are not able to conduct that much work in a sequence, you may try to create sub-tasks or sub-agents to do the work: Decompose the linalg operations into smaller sub-tasks, such as matrix_vector_products, decompositions, eigenvalues, norms, solving_equations, other_ops, and handle them using sub-agents, which store the results separately in web_utils/. If you are doing so, output the draft file list for reference.
```

### 2. (Possible Follow-up) Merge and Unify Format

**Prompt:**
```
"Merge all individual JSON files in the list in web_utils/ into a single comprehensive file with this structure:
{
  "numpy_linalg_operations": {
    "category_name": [array of functions],
    ...
  },
  "metadata": {
    "total_functions": N,
    "categories": M,
    "generated_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "source": "NumPy v2.3 documentation and GitHub repository"
  }
}"
```

### 3. Fixing Potential Issues and Fetching MoreSource Code

**Prompt:**
```
Currently, in web_utils/output/linalg_operations.json, there are some values which is not detailed docstring and source code, but rather a link to specific lines instead of a complete code which could be found on Github, fix them by using your mcp tool to fetch the doc and code from url given. For C-implemented functions, note that they are 'C implementation' with a reference.
```
