This is a specification for just 1 function: that gaussian elimination is an inverse.

To properly add imports: add leansearchclient as a dependency and `import LeanSearchClient` to use `#search` like `#eval`. It's how you can find theorems and lemmas.

example:

```lean
-- #search queries must end with a period
#search "nonsingular."
-- loogle uses type notation not strings
#loogle List ?a -> ?a

```

If a section of the book is inappropriate to translate (like chapter 1 on C programming language conventions), extract any relevant specs and leave it as prose in verso.

workflow:

1. ocr the book
2. put the book as comments/prose with verso.
3. use the agent to write the code
4. run the code and check the results
5. loop 3-4 until the code is correct
