/-- numpy.strings.less: Return the truth value of (x1 < x2) element-wise for string arrays.

    Performs element-wise string comparison between two vectors of strings.
    Returns a boolean vector indicating whether corresponding strings from x1 
    are lexicographically less than corresponding strings from x2.
    
    This function compares strings lexicographically and returns True for each
    position where x1[i] < x2[i] in lexicographic ordering, False otherwise.

/-- Specification: numpy.strings.less returns element-wise lexicographic comparison.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for string comparison)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = (x1[i] < x2[i])
    
    Mathematical Properties:
    - Asymmetric: if less x1 x2 is True at position i, then less x2 x1 is False at position i
    - Transitive: if less x1 x2 and less x2 x3 are both True at position i, then less x1 x3 is True at position i
    - Irreflexive: less x x returns all False (no string is less than itself)
    - Trichotomous: for any two strings s1 and s2, exactly one of s1 < s2, s1 = s2, or s1 > s2 holds
    - Decidable: String comparison is decidable for all strings
    - Type-safe: Result vector has same length as input vectors
