Note that the default is 'valid', unlike convolve, which uses 'full'.\n\nReturns\n-------\nout : ndarray\n    Discrete cross-correlation of a and v.\n\nNotes\n-----\nThe definition of correlation above is not unique and sometimes correlation may be defined differently. Another common definition is:\n\nc'_k = sum_n a_n * conj(v_{n+k})\n\nwhich is related to c_k by c'_k = conj(c_{-k}).",
