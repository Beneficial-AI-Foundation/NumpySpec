/-- numpy.std: Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis.

    Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a distribution,
    of the array elements. The standard deviation is computed for the flattened
    array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
    
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: std = sqrt(mean((x - x.mean())**2)).
    
    With ddof parameter, the divisor used in calculations is N - ddof,
    where N represents the number of elements.

/-- Specification: numpy.std returns the standard deviation of all elements.

    Precondition: ddof < n + 1 (to avoid division by zero or negative)
    Postcondition: result = sqrt(sum((x - mean)²) / (N - ddof))
    
    The standard deviation is computed as:
    1. Calculate the mean of all elements
    2. Calculate squared deviations from the mean
    3. Sum the squared deviations
    4. Divide by (N - ddof) where N is the number of elements
    5. Take the square root of the result
