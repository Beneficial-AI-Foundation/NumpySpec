If file is a string or a Path, the\n        \`\`.npz\`\` extension will be appended to the filename if it is not\n        already there.\n    args : Arguments, optional\n        Arrays to save to the file. Please use keyword arguments (see\n        \`kwds\` below) to assign names to arrays.  Arrays specified as\n        args will be named \"arr_0\", \"arr_1\", and so on.\n    allow_pickle : bool, optional\n        Allow saving object arrays using Python pickles. Reasons for\n        disallowing pickles include security (loading pickled data can execute\n        arbitrary code) and portability (pickled objects may not be loadable\n        on different Python installations, for example if the stored objects\n        require libraries that are not available, and not all pickled data is\n        compatible between different versions of Python).\n        Default: True\n    kwds : Keyword arguments, optional\n        Arrays to save to the file. Each array will be saved to the\n        output file with its corresponding keyword name.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    None\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    numpy.save : Save a single array to a binary file in NumPy format.\n    numpy.savetxt : Save an array to a file as plain text.\n    numpy.savez : Save several arrays into an uncompressed \`\`.npz\`\` file format\n    numpy.load : Load the files created by savez_compressed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    The \`\`.npz\`\` file format is a zipped archive of files named after the\n    variables they contain.  The archive is compressed with\n    \`\`zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED\`\` and each file in the archive contains one variable\n    in \`\`.npy\`\` format. For a description of the \`\`.npy\`\` format, see\n    :py:mod:\`numpy.lib.format\`.\n\n\n    When opening the saved \`\`.npz\`\` file with \`load\` a \`~lib.npyio.NpzFile\`\n    object is returned. This is a dictionary-like object which can be queried\n    for its list of arrays (with the \`\`.files\`\` attribute), and for the arrays\n    themselves.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> test_array = np.random.rand(3, 2)\n    >>> test_vector = np.random.rand(4)\n    >>> np.savez_compressed('/tmp/123', a=test_array, b=test_vector)\n    >>> loaded = np.load('/tmp/123.npz')\n    >>> print(np.array_equal(test_array, loaded['a']))\n    True\n    >>> print(np.array_equal(test_vector, loaded['b']))\n    True\n\n    \"\"\"\n    _savez(file, args, kwds, True, allow_pickle=allow_pickle)"
